# Front-end for a web programming project - personal portfolio

This website's front-end was done as part of a web programming project during my second year of Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Strasbourg. (Programmation Web 2, L2S4).
The front-end part is done in *Angular*. 

### It consists of 4 important parts :
- navigation bar : it allows the user to change the language for everything, including the photos, icons alt description... except for the view history/edex view of which I have yet to make a translation.
- homepage view : it shortly says who I am and it displays a phrase that I found interesting at the time... it allows links towards my socials : LinkedIn, Github, Gitlab...
- history/edex view : it's quite a long description, in a not very formal style, about who I am...
- contact view : allows for a visitor to leave a feedback, or to try and get in touch with me...
- administrator view : allows me to see the feedbacks left by the users (probably not the best idea to have this deployed with the site... maybe it should only work on local.

#### The back-end is not hosted anywhere so, the contact form will not send anything. 
If you want to check it out, here it is: https://github.com/lucianmocan/unistra-portfolio-back-php
#### To access the admin view (even if it's completely useless without the backend and database) use the following credentials :
